Final Project Directions

Project Milestone 1
Your final project will be a design and implementation of a dashboard. This dashboard will provide a useful perspective to your audience, 
and will employ the design principles that we discuss in class. As a first step, you need to define the broad topic / focus and audience 
or your project. We currently have data from Diebold that is available under the Downloads directory. You may alternatively consider 
modeling some aspect of the coronavirus. For this milestone, define the problem, the audience, and probable sources of data. Secondly,
if you have access to the data, perform some preliminary exploratory analysis, and summarize them. Submit a document addressing the above.

Project Milestone 2
In this milestone, you will present your sketch/wire frame of your dashboard. Make sure to answer the central questions from Milestone 1,
before attempting this Milestone. Here, our objective is to come up with a rough design.  Pay attention to the following:

1. What are the client requirements?
2. What is the relationship between various items of information? How should these items be arranged in the dashboard?
3. What should be the layout of your dashboard? The size? The location of each information item?
4. For each information, determine the best display media. How should information be summarized?
5. What font and color scheme will you use?

Final Deliverable: Dashboard
This is your final submission for your project, which should be a dashboard. In presenting your dashboard, remember to address 
the following questions:

1. What are the client requirements?
2. What actions will be taken based on the information presented?
3. How frequently will data be updated?

In grading the dashboard, I will consider the following characteristics:

1. Is important information highlighted
2. Choice of display media
3. Aesthetically pleasing design
4. Contextual information
5. Organization
6. Clear meanings
7. Good use of space
8. Scalable design
